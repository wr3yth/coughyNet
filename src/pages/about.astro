    <h1>fuck!</h1>
    <p>I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!</p>
    <p>This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking back and see how my journey is going!</p>
    <p>Here are a few facts about me:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>My name is {identity.firstName}.</li>
      <li>I live in {identity.country} and I am a {identity.occupation[0]}, {identity.occupation[1]} and {identity.occupation[2]}.</li>
      {identity.hobbies.length >= 2 &&
        <li>Two of my hobbies are: {identity.hobbies[0]}, {identity.hobbies[1]}, {identity.hobbies[2]} and {identity.hobbies[3]}.</li>
      }
    </ul>
    <p>My skills are:</p>
    <ul>
      {skills.map((skill) => <li class="skill">{skill}</li>)}
    </ul>
      {happy && <p>I am happy to be learning Astro!</p>}

      {finished && <p>I finished this tutorial!</p>}

      {goal === 3 ? <p>My goal is to finish in 3 days.</p> : <p>My goal is not 3 days.</p>}
