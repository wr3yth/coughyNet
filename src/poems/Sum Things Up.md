Eeny, meeny, miney, moe! hands out, it's your turn! 
Big, bad, you’re wolf now! Let’s play some "wild" thing

Way past the backyards, houses and barnyards
No time for check things: heads up! just "run" thing

No phone, no backpacks, chase me like wolf packs
Don’t eat me just yet... play me like a “prey” thing

Lure me through sub-ways, slip out of sightses
come hide in lush here, hush… feel our 'this' thing

Your taste lingers on, teeth on my tongue
Heart-rate is punching, chewed up like 'pun' thing

waiting for a bus, with no extra fuss
Door slides to the left, climb up for "ride" thing

Tough seats, our soft ass, rear-view is dim glass
let nerves be nervous, restless for "wait" thing

got "nowhere" from "where?", “what now?” we're here
Less light at evening, trains are on "rail" thing


"two" with no tickets, destined to do tricks
hums syncs with rail sound, makes it like a “song” thing 


Pick some full pockets, don't wake them "up" thing
slip through their shadow, they will miss"Not" thing

Back into the crowds, city light and crows
Freeways and fast lanes, make haste on “walk” thing

Thin way through cars, no red/green lights 
Steps are predestined, death can be a "will" thing

Stay close and keep right, don't lose my sight 
No rush, no reason, we’re down for a 'late' thing

Sandwiched by hunger, devoured by the burger
lunching and dining, fold'em as "one" thing

Night seeps in slowly, darkness glow coldly
Crawl back to the shelter, warm me with a "hug" thing

moon shines on “lust” thing, "no one but us" thing
Life can be dealt with, but "fuck" makes it "fun" thing

you touch my back now, whisper me "some"-thing:
-my turn is over, wolf up, do a "what?" thing
