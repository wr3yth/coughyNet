The moment I opened the door, I couldn’t believe my eyes.
 My whole world collapsed upon my head within seconds.  
 Never ... ever... in a million years did I expect something like that from Tyler and Olivia.  
 And there they were: those filthy scumbags, standing frozen, staring back at me like deers in headlights.

God, I wish I hadn’t seen them.  
And the worst part? My dad saw it too.

I don’t remember how we got into the car.  
 One moment we were living the moment of truth—one that nearly gave my father a stroke—and the next, we were driving.  
 I splashed some water on my face using the little sink inside the dashboard.  
 Still stunned. Still spinning. My lungs felt crushed. I couldn’t even look dad in the eyes.

He was more rattled than I was—still hadn’t processed what we saw.  
 After a long, sick silence, he turned to me and growled:

-  “This what you wanted? Huh? Is *this* what you wanted? I told you they’re not our kind. Rotten, sleazy fucks.”

I couldn’t take it anymore. I broke.  
 Tears burst out like a cracked pipe.

I had trusted Tyler and Olivia with all my heart.  
 We were just a normal little three-way family.  
 I never thought it would end up like this.

- “Maybe… just maybe, we could give them another cha—”  
-  “Shut. Your. God. Fucking. Damn. Mouth. I don’t want to hear a single word.”  
- “But they—”  
-  “Aaagh god. now you tryna defend a lowlife cuck and a shameless bitch? you could've married better people Sarah... I knew they were not decent since folks. I knew it.” 

Every time I blinked, the scene came back.  
 Sharp. Vivid. Unshakable.

When we pulled up to the house, Dad hung the car beside the house on the car-hanger and we climbed out.  
 Mr. Dickson, our overly cheerful neighbor, was walking over.

-  “Not a word in front of him. Capiche?

Dad muttered through his teeth.

I nodded. “Okay.”

Mr. Dickson said Hi and made out with dad. I reluctantly took down his pants and sucked him off as a sign of respect.

 He seemed satisfied, placed a hand gently on my head, fingers grazing my scalp, and asked with false concern:

-  “Something bothering you sweetheart?”

I didn’t reply.  
 Just covered my eyes with my elbow, pushed open the front door through tears, and brushed past Mom—who was carrying a plate of rice.  
 I went straight to my room and locked the door behind.  
 Sat down to keep on crying.

A little later, I heard the door slam.  
 Then the shouting began.

I clamped both hands over my ears, but could still hear everything.

-  “What happened, Clint? What’s wrong with Sarah? Did something happen?”  
-  “What do you *think* happened? That fucking bastard… in his own fucking house.”  
- “In his own house *what*? Just say it.”  
- “they were…”

The sound of the plate of rice falling and shattering, *split my chest open.*

-  “No. No. No. I don’t believe it. I just can’t.”  
- “Sarah opened the door. We saw everything.”  
- “You’re lying.”  
- “I wish I was. But it’s true — the guy was fucking his own wife. In their own fucking house.”

The end.
