Most of the time, it's like… I don't know. It's like there's this thick, black cloud covering everything. Like we see the world, but we don't really see the world, you know?  
We're all just stumbling around. Directionless.No sense of meaning.No sense of purpose. I know that might sound super depressing, but honestly, I think it's a good thing. Because it makes us appreciate the other times.  
Those brief, transcendent moments when the lights flicker on, the black cloud parts, and you see the world for what it really is.

     - Oh…

And suddenly there's meaning. Suddenly there's purpose.

     - So, uh, do you… Oh, shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit.

If you're lucky, you'll experience this once in your lifetime.

     - Oops! 
Goddamn, that was…

     - That was smooth.  
     - wait, what?

For me… So smooth… It happened three times.  
The **first** was the day I met her.

     - Uh, Sorry for the eggs.  
     - It’s okay. Happens to all females.  
     - so… wanna try them or?

And the **second** one… was the day I ate her.

She had been avoiding me for days, maybe weeks. I lost track of time in the chase, in the ache of wanting something I couldn’t have. Then, suddenly, she stopped running. I found her hovering near a fallen branch, her gills flaring, her body still.

    - You don’t swim with me anymore.

    - Maybe I’m tired.

    - Of me?

    - Of everything.

She flicked her tail—not for me, but to go ahead, like she was already somewhere else. And yet, for the first time, she didn’t try to disappear. She swam slowly, deliberately, as if waiting to see if I would follow.

And I did.

I trailed her through the water, watching the way she moved her taled ass. She wasn’t running. Nor she was hiding. But something in her seemed… resigned. I wanted to reach out, to press against her side, to make her *feel* something—anything—but all I could do was stay close, my shadow slipping over hers in the dim light.

    - Why are you doing this?

    - Doing what?

    - This. Following me. Chasing me. Why don’t you do what everybody else does?

She turned to face me then, and for this time, I saw a different kind of exhaustion in her eyes.

    - Because I fucking love you.

She let out a sharp exhale, something between a laugh and a sigh.

    - Me? For what?

    - I don’t know.

    - Don’t I leave enough eggs for you? Just do your thing like everybody else. It’s the way it has been forever.

    - Now you’re starting to sound like everybody else.

    - Maybe I *am* like everybody else. *Maybe you’re* the one with the problem.

Her voice cut through the water, sharp and cold.

    - Just don’t talk to me anymore. Iwish I never laid eggs while you were around. just Have fun with the eggs—mine or any other one’s eggs—but don’t creep me out following my tailed ass everywhere. 

   - is that it? You want me to get laid over anybody’s dirty eggs and get drowned by a meaningless lust and pleasure on top of that slimey goo and let myself go? 

She turned away, clearly offended. Swam forward. And this time, she wasn’t waiting for me to follow.

But I did.

I don’t know why. Maybe I had to apologize to change her mind. Maybe I wanted her to take back what she said. Maybe I wanted to understand why she looked at me like that—like I was something she didn’t recognize. But the thing is: I really did mean what I actually said. No regrets. maybe I was just ready to let go and do what others do. Just fucking colds eggs, or better to say: jerking off to eggs to make them fertile to reproduce what evolution has destined.

But I kept following.

Not beside her, not like before. This time, I stayed back, drifting just far enough to keep her butt in sight without making her turn and snap at me again. She didn’t look back. Maybe she thought I’d finally given up. Maybe she wanted to believe that.

But I hadn’t.

She moved like she always did—fluid, effortless, her silver-speckled tail cutting through the water like a ribbon unraveling into the dark. It was hypnotic. The slow flicks, the slight curves, her butthole, the way the currents shaped themselves behinf her ass. I had spent so long wanting her, chasing her, aching for the moments she let me be near, and now… now I was invisible.

And somehow, that made it easier.

I let myself enjoy it. The sight of her tail ahead of me, the shimmer of her scales catching faint light from the surface. The way the water bent around her body, parting gently before closing in again, like it belonged to her. Also she was pooping out eggs and feces off his anus from time to time. But since that moment, I didn’t keep myself from having a bit of pleasure while swimming through her excrement eggs. Her eggs smelled like her body.

I could have stayed like that forever.

But then—

Something shifted.

A pulse, deep inside me. Not a thought, not a feeling—something older, something nameless, something I couldn’t stop even if I tried.

I got wildly turned on. 

My body moved before I even knew what I was doing.

One second, I was following her ass. The next, I was trying to rip her body off part by part.

And she—

She didn’t see it coming.

I felt her before I even understood. The familiar shape, the fins, the soft press of her against the roof of my mouth. She struggled, but gave up. Every single one of  her body folding into the dark.

And then—

For the second time in my life, I felt a joyful enlightenment. While she was dead and ready to be eaten. Also the thirt time this happened was when I pooped her out and had a moment of clarity while contemplating about the philosophy of love. Flowing out smoothly from my anus.

                                    The end
